# Mails
A GUI based private mailing service utilizing local network infrastructure, created as my school project.

**Project Summary:**

Welcome to the GitHub repository for this school project! I successfully completed this project after meticulous planning, involving several weeks of preparation before embarking on the development phase. Remarkably, I accomplished the development and implementation within a tight timeframe of approximately one week.

The project focuses on the creation of a secure GUI-based private mailing service, specifically designed for organizational use. With a strong emphasis on confidentiality, this service ensures that all conversations remain within the organization's boundaries, incorporating robust security measures.

To enhance communication and user experience, I designed and implemented an elegant and user-friendly interface. This interface includes innovative features such as customizable sorting options, automated filters, and intelligent notifications, streamlining mail organization for users.

Additionally, advanced administrative features have been incorporated into the application, providing server administrators with an intuitive GUI-based platform for effortless server setup, maintenance, and moderation.

Technologies and skills utilized in this project include Python, Socket Programming, MySQL, and Systems Design.

Thank you for your interest in this project. Feel free to explore the repository and provide any feedback or contributions.

## Note: Project Status
Please note that due to a PyQt5 update, the current version of the project/app may experience some temporary compatibility issues with ARM devices. Please be aware that I haven't had sufficient time to address this issue or upgrade it to PyQt6 (which will be done shortly). As a result, the functionality may not work as intended at the moment.

Additionally, it's important to note that the project/app is missing a few planned features that were originally intended. However, I plan to implement these features in the near future.

I'll also be adding a thorough documentation to go along with the project explaining all the elements which are used or required for this project and steps to deploy and utilize the application effectively. The documentation will serve as a helpful guide throughout your exploration and utilization of the app.

Thank you for your understanding and patience as I work on improving the project/app.
